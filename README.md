# Buchsuche
#### An app that lets you search books and display cover images using the OpenLibrary API.
The user can use the SearchView to search for books with title which then displays the required list. After a user selects a book from the 
list, a second screen appears displaying additional details about the book, including the publisher and no. of pages. 

A progress bar is also implemented. We can also recommend books to other people.
